        <h1>My Favorite Story</h1>
        <p>I really enjoy reading Greek myths. My favorite one is the story of Eros and Psyche.
            Essentially Psyche is a Greek princess who catches the eye of Aphrodite, who is extremely jealous of her beauty.
            Aphrodite attempts to get her son, Eros, to make her fall in love with something hideous, but he ends up falling in love instead.
            Eros whisks her away to his palace, but shenanigans ensue and Psyche is forced to complete some trials.
            It is a long story, so I have linked a fantastic video that tells the story in a fun way:

        <h1>Artwork</h1>
        <p>I enjoy drawing digital illustrations. Here is something that I had to make for another class recently. They wanted a collage of our favorite things.</p>
