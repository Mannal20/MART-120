        <h1 class="title" >My Favorite Story</h1>
        <p class="content">
            I really enjoy reading Greek myths. My favorite one is the story of Eros and Psyche.
            Essentially Psyche is a Greek princess who catches the eye of Aphrodite, who is extremely jealous of her beauty.
            Aphrodite attempts to get her son, Eros, to make her fall in love with something hideous, but he ends up falling in love instead.
            Eros whisks her away to his palace, he keeps himself invisible and tells Psyche that she cannot visibly see him.
            One night, Psyche gets curious and goes to visit Eros as he sleeps, and discovers that he is the God of Love.
            She accidently splashes some candle wax on him and he flees feeling betrayed.
            Aphrodite steps in and tells Psyche that she can redeem herself if she can sort some grain, gather golden fleece from man-eating rams, gather water from the river Styx, and to go to the Underworld to put some of Persephone's beauty in a box.
            Once she has the beauty in the box, Psyche wants to freshen up for when she's reunited with Eros, but instead gets a faceful of death.
            Eros, feeling better and over the betrayl, brings Psyche back to life and they get married.
            It is a long story, so I have linked a FANTASTIC video that tells the story in a fun way:</span>
